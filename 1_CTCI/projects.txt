interested in finding ways to apply and improve my C++ development skills. 
currently working as  C++ developer at upsate medical and my main goal is to use the best design practice to build the tool itself

2) ive built mutli-threaded applications like type-based dep analyzer
3) nosqlDB
4) in my design pattern course i presented on flyweight pattern and how it can be used to build digital CAD applications
5) ive also presented on observer and decorator pattern


6) CPGUI C++ proj at upstate
7) graph visualization tool (elapse using physics laws) //  d3.js tool



8) privacy mirror tool where we build annotated objects and styles using templates already available in android



std::mutex mtx;           // mutex for critical section

void print_thread_id (int id) {
  // critical section (exclusive access to std::cout signaled by locking mtx):
  mtx.lock();
  std::cout << "thread #" << id << '\n';
  mtx.unlock();
}



std::thread threads[10];
  // spawn 10 threads:
  for (int i=0; i<10; ++i)
    threads[i] = std::thread(print_thread_id,i+1);

  for (auto& th : threads) th.join()
