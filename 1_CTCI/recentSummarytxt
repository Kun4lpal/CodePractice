 If you have other offers and or are interviewing other companies, be transparent about it. It will help your case. If Google is your top choice then let the the recruiter know. 

 Ask questions. About the interview process, what to expect, how they decide who interviews you, what will be the focus areas, what is the expected time to come back with an answer, is it ok if you do bad in one or two interviews etc.

 Stay responsive. If you are keeping it up at your end, your recruiter will be more serious about you. If you replies are delayed or if you are unresponsive, then expect the same.
