1) my first software development experience was at Airtel where i worked on Java/SQL/HTML/CSS/Javascript
2) one of my project managers provided me a refernce for a full time job at diverse infotech
3) Then i decided to pursue Master's in CE because i wanted to learn more
4) the most interesting academic projects in my first year i worked on were dependency analyzer and remote test harness

Then i joined SALT Lab last summer - where we work on privacy/human interaction and accessiblity
Later in the last semester my professor recommended me to the image processing role because i had gained some experience in it.
